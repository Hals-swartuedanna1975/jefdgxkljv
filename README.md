Wow…so just got out of the theater, still have this weird ringing in my ears from all the explosions. Or was it the sound of the guy next to me snoring? Can't tell, honestly. Anyway, Minecraft Movie! Geez, it felt like I was inside a pixelated hurricane. You know that feeling when you dream of flying but suddenly the dream turns into you swimming in jello? That's kinda what this was like.

My back is sore, these theater seats are like medieval torture devices, really. Popcorn all over, and I’m pretty sure I sat on some of it. Anyway, so there's this kid, Steve, or maybe it was Alex? Whatever, they’re like trying to save their blocky world from...some kind of thingy. World eater? Brain eater? Something eater. The animation was like if someone tried to make a Picasso painting move, but with more blocks. Sounds weirdly beautiful, right? But also, maybe accidentally avant-garde.

> Can't forget the creepers, exploding everywhere like someone put mentos in a coke geyser. The noise level just added to my existing headache, but that’s what you get when you’re practically vibrating in your seat from surround sound. I think Steve/Alex had a pet llama at some point, or maybe it was just a misplaced sheep. Either way, it added some charm, you know, the fluffy kind that's almost too much? Like cotton candy with extra sugar.

I remember hearing someone (was it you?) say you wanted to download the movie. Maybe just watch the movie at home, when you can pause and ponder what the block is happening without the smell of fake butter haunting you.

At some point, they built or destroyed something, and it all seemed so… urgent. Like when you're trying to find a clean bathroom at a festival but way more dramatic. Oh, and the part with the Ender Dragon, sooo epic! It was chasing them like some deranged, misunderstood art project.

Man, still feeling like I just walked out of an IMAX screen into another dimension. Is my wallet still in my pocket? Hopefully didn’t trade it for more popcorn while I was dazed. Easy to get lost in these cinema jungles.

```cpp
if (dragon_is_real) {
    run_away();
} else {
    build_house();
    //what was I coding again
}
```
